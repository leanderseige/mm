# MM

MM is a multi media framework I developed in 2007 to build interactive terminals
in museums. It has many features is quite powerful but also very hacky und buggy.
MM is based on SDL, OpenGL and has an interactive GTK editor. It display images
and text, plays digital videos and sounds. All elements can be 3D-animated because
of the OpenGL. It also features interfacing with some special devices for blind
people to interactively feel digital images by moving a braille device.

Be warned: I uploaded this software for the documentation purposes. If you want
to use it better be prepared for fixing many bugs and hacks.
